Git Merge vs. Git Rebase
git merge
git merge is used to combine the changes from one branch into another. It creates a new merge commit that ties together the histories of both branches.

Use case: When you want to preserve the complete history of both branches.
Pros:
Maintains the context of the original branches.
Easier to understand the timeline of feature development.
Cons:
Can lead to a more cluttered history with many merge commits.
